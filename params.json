Stateroom aims to provide a simple and easy to understand framework for creating state machines.\r\n\r\n# How do I get it?\r\n\r\nStateroom was at a release candidate 2, however, it was retracted due to the desire to improve the modularity of the distributable jars. Please check out the downloads section and try it out the RC2.\r\n\r\n# How do I use it?\r\n\r\nA getting started guide is being finalized and will be posted to the Wiki soon.
